Implemented Artificial Neural Network(ANN) model and Adaptive Network based Fuzzy Inference System(ANFIS) to predict the concentration of Ozone (O3) and Nitrogen Dioxide(NO2) in the next 8 hours. Data was collected from CPCB for one station(IGI Airport) over the period of 5 years 2011-15 at the intervals of 8 hours. Feature set consisted of particulate concentration levels like O3, NO2, CO, CO2, SO2,etc and meteorological phenomena like wind speed, temperature, humidity, etc.
Improved the performance of both the models by using Principal Component Analysis(PCA) to reduce feature dimensionality.
PCA - ANFIS outperformed all the other models.
Tools used : Matlab, Python
